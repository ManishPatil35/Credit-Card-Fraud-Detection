# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
This Python code uses logistic regression to build a fraud detection model on a credit card dataset. It addresses imbalanced data by creating a balanced sample and evaluates the model's accuracy on both training and testing data. The logistic regression model is trained, and its performance is assessed using accuracy metrics.
