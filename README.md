# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
This Python code uses logistic regression to build a fraud detection model on a credit card dataset. It addresses imbalanced data by creating a balanced sample and evaluates the model's accuracy on both training and testing data. The logistic regression model is trained, and its performance is assessed using accuracy metrics.

The code is Break-down Below for Understanding

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing:**
   - The code starts by importing necessary libraries and loading a credit card dataset from a CSV file using Pandas.
   - Missing values in specific columns (`V23`, `V24`, `V25`, `V26`, `V27`, `V28`, `Amount`, and `Class`) are imputed with the mean of each respective column.
   - The 'Class' column is then converted to integers.

2. **Handling Imbalanced Data:**
   - It acknowledges that the data is imbalanced with a large number of normal transactions (Class=0) and a low number of fraud transactions (Class=1).
   - To address this, the code samples a balanced dataset by selecting a random subset of normal transactions equal to the number of fraud transactions.

3. **Creating a Balanced Dataset:**
   - A sample of normal transactions (`Legit_sample`) is obtained by randomly selecting 103 samples from the original normal transactions.
   - This sampled dataset is then concatenated with the fraud transactions to create a new dataset (`newdf`), aiming for a balanced distribution.

4. **Feature-Target Split:**
   - The dataset is split into features (`X`) and the target variable (`y`), where 'Class' is the target variable.

5. **Train-Test Split:**
   - The data is split into training and testing sets using the `train_test_split` function with a test size of 20%, stratified sampling, and a random seed for reproducibility.

6. **Logistic Regression Model Initialization:**
   - A logistic regression model is initialized with a maximum number of iterations (`max_iter`) set to 1000 to address convergence warnings.

7. **Model Training:**
   - The logistic regression model is trained using the training data (`X_train` and `y_train`) with the `fit` method.

8. **Model Evaluation on Training Data:**
   - The model's performance is evaluated on the training data by calculating the accuracy score using the `accuracy_score` function.

9. **Model Evaluation on Testing Data:**
   - Similarly, the model's performance is evaluated on the testing data, and the accuracy score is calculated.

10. **Print Results:**
    - The training and testing accuracy scores are printed to the console for analysis.
